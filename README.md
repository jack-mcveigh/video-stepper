## Purpose
To view view frame by frame footage of any mp4 video.

## Overview
The originally intended use was to view a loop of all nine main Star Wars movies buffered frame by frame with the effect of a slideshow. Now, the tool can play playlists of movies/tv shows, such as the Star Wars franchise and Friends, or single videos such as single movies or homemade movies.
